# Swift6502

A Swift package that implements all opcodes for a MOS 6502 processor along with tests.

Swift6502 is **not** ready for the prime time. It has only been tested against the tests provided, so will almost certainly fail when presented with real world code.

Swift6502 is only the CPU core. There is no I/O.
